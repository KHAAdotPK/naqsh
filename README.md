## What is naqsh?

**naqsh** (نقش) is a C++ library for reading, cleaning, normalizing, and tokenizing Urdu text encoded in UTF-8.

Urdu presents unique challenges for text processing: a right-to-left script built on Arabic with its own extended characters, invisible formatting characters like the Zero-Width Non-Joiner, mixed-script content (Urdu alongside digits and Latin), and multiple Unicode representations of the same letter. Most general-purpose parsers ignore these entirely. naqsh is built specifically around them.

The name comes from the Urdu/Persian word نقش — meaning *pattern* or *imprint*.

## What it does right now

### Hand-rolled UTF-8 decoder

naqsh decodes UTF-8 byte sequences manually, one code point at a time, without relying on any external library. It understands the full 1–4 byte structure and handles malformed input through one of two compile-time policies:

- **`DROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE`** — the entire claimed sequence is discarded when any continuation byte is invalid. Aggressive but simple.
- **Default (no flag)** — follows Unicode §3.9 maximal-subpart recovery: only the lead byte is discarded, and the offending byte is re-examined as the start of a new sequence. This means a valid ASCII character immediately following a bad lead byte is never lost.

### Punctuation removal

A `static unordered_set<char32_t>` is built once from `PunctuationSymbols.hh` and used for O(1) lookup on every code point. The set covers:

- Core Urdu punctuation: `۔` `،` `؛` `؟`
- Latin punctuation: `.` `,` `:` `;` `!` `"` `(` `)` and more
- Hyphens, dashes, ellipsis, curly quotes, angle quotes
- Arabic-specific symbols: `٪` `٭` `؉` `؊`
- Tatweel/Kashida `ـ` (U+0640) — a stretching character used for visual emphasis with no linguistic meaning
- Additional separators and brackets

The set is defined in `PunctuationSymbols.hh` and is straightforward to extend.

### Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) handling

ZWNJ (`U+200C`) appears in Urdu text to control letter joining. naqsh handles two cases:

- **Trailing ZWNJ** — silently removed
- **ZWNJ between two Urdu letters** — replaced with a space, correctly splitting the display compound into two tokens

```
خوب‌صورت  →  خوب صورت
```

Zero-Width Joiner (`U+200D`) is intentionally left untouched — it signals that two characters should render as one glyph and is considered part of the token.

### Operator preservation between digits

`:`, `+`, `.`, and `٫` are in the punctuation set and would normally be stripped. A state machine detects the pattern `digit operator digit` and re-emits the operator, preserving time values, arithmetic expressions, and decimal numbers.

```
10:30    →  10:30    colon preserved
۲+۳      →  ۲+۳      plus preserved
3.14     →  3.14     decimal dot preserved
3٫14     →  3٫14     Arabic decimal separator preserved
10+3+5   →  10+3+5   chained plus preserved
اردو:    →  اردو     colon not between digits, stripped
۱. آج    →  ۱ آج     ordinal dot not followed by digit, stripped
Rs. 500  →  Rs 500   abbreviation dot not followed by digit, stripped
```

All three digit systems are recognized: Western `0–9`, Eastern Arabic `٠–٩`, Urdu `۰–۹`.

### Dot preservation between alpha sequences

A second state machine detects the pattern `alpha DOT alpha` and preserves the dot, enabling correct handling of domain names and file extensions in mixed Urdu text.

```
urdu.com      →  urdu.com     alpha dot alpha, preserved
www.urdu.com  →  www.urdu.com chained dots, preserved
data.csv      →  data.csv     file extension, preserved
Rs.500        →  Rs 500       alpha dot digit, dropped
ver.2         →  ver 2        alpha dot digit, dropped
```

The two machines share a single `pendingDot` slot with an ownership flag (`dotSetByDigitMachine`) to prevent them from incorrectly claiming each other's dot.

### Unicode normalization

A `normalize` function maps visually identical but code-point-distinct characters to a single canonical form before they are written to the output. Called for every alpha character and every digit as each passes through the cleaner.

**Letter normalization** — Arabic keyboards and Urdu keyboards produce different code points for the same letter:

| Input | Canonical | Description |
|---|---|---|
| U+0643 `ك` | U+06A9 `ک` | Arabic kaf → Urdu keheh |
| U+064A `ي` | U+06CC `ی` | Arabic yeh → Farsi yeh |
| U+0647 `ه` | U+06C1 `ہ` | Arabic heh → heh goal |

**Hamza normalization** — multiple alif forms collapsed to plain alif:

| Input | Canonical | Description |
|---|---|---|
| U+0623 `أ` | U+0627 `ا` | Alif with hamza above |
| U+0625 `إ` | U+0627 `ا` | Alif with hamza below |
| U+0671 `ٱ` | U+0627 `ا` | Alif wasla |

U+0622 `آ` (Alif with madda) is intentionally excluded — the madda indicates a long vowel that changes the word's identity (`آج` "today", `آپ` "you"). Collapsing it to plain alif would produce non-existent words.

**Digit normalization** — Eastern Arabic digits and Urdu digits are visually similar but distinct code points. Arabic-layout keyboards emit the Eastern Arabic form while Urdu text conventionally uses the Urdu form:

| Input | Canonical |
|---|---|
| U+0660–U+0669 `٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩` | U+06F0–U+06F9 `۰۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹` |

Digit normalization is applied inside the digit state machine so that operator preservation and normalization work correctly together — `٣٫١٤` becomes `۳٫۱۴` with the decimal separator intact.

### Whitespace normalization

`collapseSpace` runs as a post-processing step on the output of `cleanLine`. It collapses runs of consecutive whitespace characters to a single space and strips leading and trailing whitespace. Characters treated as whitespace:

- U+0020 space
- U+0009 tab
- U+00A0 non-breaking space
- U+061C Arabic letter mark

### UTF-8 encoder

`appendCodePoint` encodes any `char32_t` code point back to UTF-8 bytes and appends to a `std::string`. Used internally by the normalization path to emit the canonical form of a normalized character.

## File structure

```
naqsh/
├── header.hh                  ←  top-level include, pulls in both libraries
└── lib/
    ├── Cleaner.hh             ←  UTF-8 decoder, cleanLine, state machines,
    │                              normalization, collapseSpace
    └── PunctuationSymbols.hh  ←  Unicode code point definitions
```

---

## Usage

```cpp
#include "header.hh"

int main()
{
    Cleaner cleaner;

    std::string line = "اسلام علیکم! آج کا دن 10:30 بجے شروع ہوا۔";
    std::string cleaned = cleaner.cleanLine(line);

    // result: "اسلام علیکم آج کا دن 10:30 بجے شروع ہوا"

    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling

```bash
# Standard mode — Unicode §3.9 recovery (recommended)
g++ -std=c++17 -o my_program main.cpp

# Drop mode — discard entire invalid sequence
g++ -std=c++17 -DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE -o my_program main.cpp

# Custom delimiter (default is comma)
g++ -std=c++17 -DCSV_PARSER_TOKEN_DELIMITER='\t' -o my_program main.cpp
```

## What naqsh wants to become

naqsh is currently a cleaner and normalizer. The goal is a full Urdu tokenizer API where the caller can iterate over lines and tokens the same way they would in any modern NLP pipeline.

### Phase 1 — Tokenization
A `tokenize` method that returns a `std::vector<std::string>` of discrete tokens from a cleaned line. Consecutive spaces collapsed, empty tokens discarded, leading and trailing whitespace handled inside the library rather than pushed to the caller.

### Phase 2 — Extended normalization
- URL and domain name detection to preserve full URLs as single tokens rather than relying on the alpha-dot-alpha heuristic
- Diacritic stripping as an optional mode — zabar, zer, pesh, shadda removed or preserved depending on caller preference

### Phase 3 — Document and line API

```cpp
// Conceptual future interface
Document doc("urdu_corpus.txt");

for (auto& line : doc.lines()) {
    for (auto& token : line.tokens()) {
        std::cout << token.text()       << "\n";  // token text
        std::cout << token.byteOffset() << "\n";  // position in original
        std::cout << token.type()       << "\n";  // Urdu / Latin / Digit / Mixed
    }
}
```

### Phase 4 — Token metadata
- Diacritics separated from the base letter and accessible independently
- Token type classification: Urdu, Latin, Digit, Mixed, Punctuation
- Original byte offset preserved so tokens can be mapped back to the source text

## Design decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Hand-rolled UTF-8 decoder | Full control at the byte level, zero external dependencies |
| `char32_t` code points | Correct comparison for multi-byte Urdu characters |
| `static unordered_set` | Punctuation set built once, not per line |
| Compile-time recovery policy | Caller decides how aggressive invalid-byte handling should be |
| Exclusions before letter ranges in `isUrduLetter` | Guarantees non-letters are never accepted even if ranges are later widened |
| State machines for ZWNJ, colon, plus, and dot | These are contextual rules — a simple character lookup cannot handle them |
| `pendingDot` shared between digit and alpha machines | One ownership flag (`dotSetByDigitMachine`) makes the interaction explicit rather than relying on execution order |
| Digit normalization inside the digit state machine | Ensures operator preservation and normalization work in the correct order — the operator is re-emitted before the normalized digit is appended |
| `normalize` as a pure switch table | Adding a new normalization is a one-line change with no risk of affecting other code paths |
| U+0622 excluded from hamza normalization | Alif with madda is a distinct phoneme in Urdu — collapsing it to plain alif produces non-existent words |
| `collapseSpace` as a separate post-processing step | Keeps the main decode loop simple — whitespace normalization runs once on the finished string |

## Current limitations

- `cleanLine` returns a cleaned `std::string` — it does not yet return a vector of tokens. The caller must still split on spaces.
- Method definitions live in `.hh` files. Including from multiple translation units will cause linker errors. This will be resolved when the library is split into `.hh`/`.cc` pairs.
- No dictionary, morphology, or grammar — naqsh is a tokenizer, not an NLP framework.
- URL detection uses an alpha-dot-alpha heuristic. Full URL preservation (`https://urdu.com`) is deferred to Phase 2.
- Religious and honorific ligatures (U+FDFA `ﷺ`, U+FDFB `ﷻ`, U+FDF2 `ﷲ`,
  and approximately 60 similar code points in the Arabic Presentation Forms
  block U+FB50–U+FDFF) are passed through untouched as single opaque tokens.
  naqsh is designed for general Urdu NLP pipelines — news, literature,
  legal and government text — where these ligatures do not appear in
  significant quantities. Corpora containing religious text require a
  domain-specific pre-processing layer before calling `cleanLine()`.
  See the comment block in `normalize()` for the full list and rationale.
