/*
    The /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE is a compile time flag
    -------------------------------------------------------
    A deliberate policy choice, treat the whole claimed sequence as garbage and discard it.
    The len is already set to the number of bytes in the sequence... 
    The /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE skips the entire invalid sequence.

    Need for ifndef /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE
    --------------------------------------------
    Consider this specific byte sequence in memory: [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
    - 0xE0 → 3-byte lead byte, so len = 3
    - 0x41 → not a valid continuation byte (must start with 10xx xxxx)
    - 0x80 → valid continuation byte

    Without /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE:
    - Inner loop runs for j = 1 and j = 2
    - On j = 1, 0x41 is invalid → inner loop breaks
    - i increments by 1 (only the 0xE0 byte)
    - Next iteration starts at 0x41, which is treated as a new sequence
    - Result: 0xE0 is dropped, 0x41 is treated as a separate character

    With /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE:
    - Inner loop runs for j = 1 and j = 2
    - On j = 1, 0x41 is invalid (but a valid ASCII 'A') so validUTF8Sequence = false
    - Inner loop breaks
    - Outer loop increments i by len (which is 3)
    - Entire [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80] sequence is skipped
    - Next iteration starts after the invalid sequence

    Conclusion
    ----------
    So the policy of "skip the whole declared length" is only safe if you trust that the bytes following the bad lead byte genuinely belong to the broken sequence.
    But a bad lead byte followed immediately by a valid ASCII byte is a real-world corruption pattern, and your code discards the ASCII byte.

                    Recovery policy: only skip bytes up to (not including) the
                    first byte that failed the continuation check.

                    A UTF-8 lead byte declares how many bytes belong to its
                    sequence (len). If one of those continuation bytes turns out
                    to be invalid, we have two choices:

                    (A) Skip all len bytes  -- the original implicit behaviour.
                        Simple, but destructive: the byte at position j that
                        FAILED the check may itself be a valid lead byte or a
                        valid ASCII character. Skipping it silently discards
                        data that was never part of the broken sequence.

                        Example:  [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
                                  lead    'A'   continuation
                        Option A skips all three, 'A' is lost.

                    (B) Skip only j bytes (i.e. set len = j)  -- chosen here.
                        We discard only the lead byte and the continuation bytes
                        we have already consumed up to the point of failure.
                        The offending byte at position j is left untouched so
                        the outer loop re-examines it as the start of a new
                        sequence on the very next iteration.

                        Same example with option B:
                            [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
                        Option B skips only [0xE0], then re-examines [0x41]
                        which decodes correctly as ASCII 'A'.

                    This is the standard "maximal subpart" recovery recommended
                    by Unicode 15 §3.9 (Conformance): replace only the shortest
                    ill-formed subsequence, then resume decoding from the next
                    byte. Setting len = j implements exactly that boundary.

            State machine: preserve operator between two digits
            ===================================================
            Handles colon (U+003A), plus (U+002B), and dot/decimal separator
            (U+002E, U+066B) that appear between two digit characters. All three
            are in ALL_PUNCTUATION and would normally be stripped. This state
            machine detects the digit-operator-digit pattern and re-emits the
            operator before the second digit is appended.

            Digit sets recognized:
                Western Arabic   0–9     (U+0030–U+0039)
                Eastern Arabic   ٠–٩     (U+0660–U+0669)
                Urdu             ۰–۹     (U+06F0–U+06F9)

            Cases handled:

                10:30           →  10:30       colon between two digits, preserved
                10+3            →  10+3        plus between two digits, preserved
                3.14            →  3.14        dot between two digits, preserved
                3٫14            →  3٫14        Arabic decimal separator, preserved
                10+3+5          →  10+3+5      chained plus, all preserved
                10:30:45        →  10:30:45    chained colons, all preserved
                3.14+2          →  3.14+2      mixed operators, all preserved
                ۲+۳             →  ۲+۳         Urdu digits with plus, preserved
                ۱۰:۳۰           →  ۱۰:۳۰       Urdu digits with colon, preserved

                ۱. آج           →  ۱ آج        ordinal dot not followed by digit, dropped
                اردو:           →  اردو        colon not preceded by digit, dropped

                10:             →  10          colon not followed by digit, dropped
                10:abc          →  10 abc      colon not followed by digit, dropped
                10:+5           →  105         chained operators — both stripped, digits
                                               concatenate directly. No space is inserted
                                               because the cleaner only re-emits operators,
                                               it never synthesizes separators. This is
                                               acceptable: digit-operator-operator sequences

                                     (after digit) or the alpha machine (after alpha);
                                     0 means no dot pending
                dotSetByDigitMachine — true when pendingDot was set by the digit machine,

                                     whether a digit or alpha arriving next should
                                     re-emit or discard the dot.

            Invariant: isColonFound, isPlusOperatorFound, and pendingDot are mutually
            exclusive within the digit machine. pendingDot is additionally shared with
            the alpha machine — dotSetByDigitMachine records ownership.

            Re-emit order in the isDigit branch: pendingDot is checked first, then
            isPlusOperatorFound, then isColonFound. Order does not affect correctness
            since the flags are mutually exclusive, but dot is listed first as it is
            the most recently added operator.

 *   U+0020  SPACE              — standard ASCII space
 *   U+0009  TAB                — horizontal tab
 *   U+00A0  NO-BREAK SPACE     — non-breaking space (UTF-8: 0xC2 0xA0)
 *                                common in copy-pasted web text
 *   U+061C  ARABIC LETTER MARK — invisible RTL/LTR directional mark
 *                                (UTF-8: 0xD8 0x9C), appears in some
 *                                Urdu editors and word processors
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Any run of one or more whitespace code points is replaced by a
 *     single ASCII space U+0020
 *   - Leading whitespace is stripped entirely (the !collapsed.empty()
 *     guard suppresses the space emission before the first non-whitespace
 *     character)
 *   - Trailing whitespace is stripped entirely (inWhitespace being true
 *     at end-of-string means nothing was appended for that final run)
 *   - Invalid UTF-8 bytes are skipped silently, consistent with the
 *     policy of the main decoder in cleanLine()
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "  Hello   World\t"  →  "Hello World"
 *   "\tیہ   اردو   ہے"   →  "یہ اردو ہے"
 *   "urdu.com  "         →  "urdu.com"
 *
 * @param result  UTF-8 encoded string, typically the output of cleanLine()
 * @return        A new string with whitespace runs collapsed and
 *                leading/trailing whitespace removed

 *   Section 5 — Eastern Arabic digit normalization
 *     Eastern Arabic digits (U+0660–U+0669) and Urdu digits (U+06F0–U+06F9)
 *     are visually similar but distinct code points. Arabic-layout keyboards
 *     and some Arabic text sources emit the Eastern Arabic form while Urdu
 *     text conventionally uses the Urdu form. Without normalization the same
 *     numeral in two encodings produces two different token strings.
 *     All ten digits are mapped to the Urdu canonical form:
 *     U+0660  ٠  →  U+06F0  ۰
 *     U+0661  ١  →  U+06F1  ۱
 *     U+0662  ٢  →  U+06F2  ۲
 *     U+0663  ٣  →  U+06F3  ۳
 *     U+0664  ٤  →  U+06F4  ۴
 *     U+0665  ٥  →  U+06F5  ۵
 *     U+0666  ٦  →  U+06F6  ۶
 *     U+0667  ٧  →  U+06F7  ۷
 *     U+0668  ٨  →  U+06F8  ۸
 *     U+0669  ٩  →  U+06F9  ۹
 *
 * @param cp  Unicode code point (32-bit value)
 * @return    Canonical code point, or cp unchanged if no normalization applies
