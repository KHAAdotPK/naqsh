    The /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE is a compile time flag
    -------------------------------------------------------
    A deliberate policy choice, treat the whole claimed sequence as garbage and discard it.
    The len is already set to the number of bytes in the sequence... 
    The /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE skips the entire invalid sequence.

    Need for ifndef /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE
    --------------------------------------------
    Consider this specific byte sequence in memory: [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
    - 0xE0 → 3-byte lead byte, so len = 3
    - 0x41 → not a valid continuation byte (must start with 10xx xxxx)
    - 0x80 → valid continuation byte

    Without /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE:
    - Inner loop runs for j = 1 and j = 2
    - On j = 1, 0x41 is invalid → inner loop breaks
    - i increments by 1 (only the 0xE0 byte)
    - Next iteration starts at 0x41, which is treated as a new sequence
    - Result: 0xE0 is dropped, 0x41 is treated as a separate character

    With /DDROP_INVALID_UTF8_SEQUENCE:
    - Inner loop runs for j = 1 and j = 2
    - On j = 1, 0x41 is invalid (but a valid ASCII 'A') so validUTF8Sequence = false
    - Inner loop breaks
    - Outer loop increments i by len (which is 3)
    - Entire [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80] sequence is skipped
    - Next iteration starts after the invalid sequence

    Conclusion
    ----------
    So the policy of "skip the whole declared length" is only safe if you trust that the bytes following the bad lead byte genuinely belong to the broken sequence.
    But a bad lead byte followed immediately by a valid ASCII byte is a real-world corruption pattern, and your code discards the ASCII byte.

                    Recovery policy: only skip bytes up to (not including) the
                    first byte that failed the continuation check.

                    A UTF-8 lead byte declares how many bytes belong to its
                    sequence (len). If one of those continuation bytes turns out
                    to be invalid, we have two choices:

                    (A) Skip all len bytes  -- the original implicit behaviour.
                        Simple, but destructive: the byte at position j that
                        FAILED the check may itself be a valid lead byte or a
                        valid ASCII character. Skipping it silently discards
                        data that was never part of the broken sequence.

                        Example:  [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
                                  lead    'A'   continuation
                        Option A skips all three, 'A' is lost.

                    (B) Skip only j bytes (i.e. set len = j)  -- chosen here.
                        We discard only the lead byte and the continuation bytes
                        we have already consumed up to the point of failure.
                        The offending byte at position j is left untouched so
                        the outer loop re-examines it as the start of a new
                        sequence on the very next iteration.

                        Same example with option B:
                            [0xE0] [0x41] [0x80]
                        Option B skips only [0xE0], then re-examines [0x41]
                        which decodes correctly as ASCII 'A'.

                    This is the standard "maximal subpart" recovery recommended
                    by Unicode 15 §3.9 (Conformance): replace only the shortest
                    ill-formed subsequence, then resume decoding from the next
                    byte. Setting len = j implements exactly that boundary.
